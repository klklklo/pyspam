# pyspam
<!--Basic information-->
pyspam is a Python3 implementation of models of the X-ray, extreme and far ultraviolet radiation spectra of the Sun described by A.A. Nusinov. 
The EUV model describes variations in the 5–105 nm spectral region, which are responsible for the ionization of the main components of the earth’s atmosphere.
The FUV model describes the flux changes in the 115–242 nm region, which determines heating of the upper atmosphere and the dissociation of molecular oxygen.
The input parameter for both models is the intensity of the photon flux in the Lyman-alpha line, which has been measured for decades. 
Using this parameter allows you to calculate solar radiation fluxes for any period of time.
